**Legacy**:

Il y a du pouvoir dans le sang des mages, plus puissant est le mage, plus puissant est son sang.

Quand la grande guerre prit fin, et que les humains changèrent l'ordre du monde, nombreuses furent les familles mages dont le noble statut perdit toute signification. 

Fervnat croyants dans la doctrine du sang, la famille Ashford refusa de souiller la pureté de leur lignée en la dilluant. Et durant le siècle qui suivi, ils s'abstinrent de toute union avec d'autre familles. Mais leurs efforts furent vain. Le siècle passa, et leur gloire avec elle; car aucun de leur héritier ne parvint à égaler les prodiges de leurs prestigieux ancètres.

Ivan Asford aurait du être banni pour s'être détourné des dogmes familliales en épousant Ellena. Pourtant, après son un entretien privé avec le pratriarche de la famille, il fut autorisé à conserver son rand. Nul ne sait quel accord secret ils passèrent, mais 

Que pouvait il bien lui offrir pour qu'une sixième née accepte de se lier à un troisième d'une famille de renom moindre que la sienne? Nul ne le sut jamais, si ce n'est Alastar Ashford, patriarche de la famille, qui approuva leur union à la surprise générale.

**Biography** :
Malika Comes from a once grand but now forgotten family of mages, who desperately cling to their tradition in hope for the return of their glorius past. Her parents specificaly marry each other in order to create a child with strong magic power according to the rule of blood, and as she grew up, they kept teling her that she had to be the miracle to save the family. She was taught from a young age the family magic and endured dangerous and painful rituals in order to develop her talent. When she grew mature enough to cast her first spell, her parents gave her an artefact, supposed to reveal her potential and demanded she perform a spell for them. But she could not. Realizing she was a failure and useless for their goal, they hid her form the rest of the family and turn all their attention toward other methods to create a strong heir. Another heir. 

Malika was enceforth abandonned by her parents and raised by the maid who was more of a mother to her than her own. She gave her the nickname ???, the proud and ever stray cat and kept telling her, she has a monster living in her heart, which will always defend her from the arsh word. For her 12 birthday she gave her a miniature panther, it was the first time she ever received a present for her birthday.

Her birthday was also the first time she has to be presented to the rest of the family. To avoid the shame of raising a failure her parent cast a spell to prevent her from talking and clamed to the rest of the family it was an accident from a ritual. Malika saw this day what her parents expected from her whan she witness her cousins perform advanced magic, and realized her parents might have been right to label her a failure. Unable to defend herself, she quickly became the target of her cousins bullying and since she could not talk she could not tell or ask for help. They ended up chasing her into the woods and joked that they will tear her tongue since she does not need it. Afraid and isolated, she closed her eyes and held her miniature against her chest, praying for her monster to come to her defense. She became that day the youngest mage to cast a fully corporial invocation. A ghostly panther spawned from her toy and attacked her cousine, the one leading the pack, and slashed her face. She felt pride, and realised that she now held the key to her parents love. But unable to tell her version of the story, only her cousine could tell the adults how she attacked them without a reason and disfigured her while laughing.

She ran away when she was 16 and lived in the streets.
At 18 she was arrested for killing a human under self defense and was put under the dean's care.
She ran away from the academy after a week to join Alec's gang.
She always wears a miniature panther broken in half attached to a cord around her neck.
