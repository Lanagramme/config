## Ralentissement psychomoteur

Sometime my brain gets stuck, like I know what I have to do, or I know the steps of the computation, but my brain refuse to operate and I feel more and more tired the more I try to force it until I forget what I was trying to do, or I suddently think of someting else that hog all the spotlignt in my mind and I can't think of anything else. Sometimes I get a suddent flash of the answer but immediately forget.
I have a very bad memory and I have issue feeling the passage of time.

I feel like a fraud, because sometimes I can do anything I set my mind up to and sometimes I can't take a shower, but I don't feel any different, I'm just sad and overwhelmed.
I get stucked in my head and the idea of interracting with another human or leaving my house triggers my fight or flight response.

I can't set up appointments.

## desir de mort

I don't really want to kill myself, I don't want to commit to the action, but I feel like being alive is painfull, the feeling of passing time hurts me, make me nant to puke, it feels like my nervous system is being pulled out of my body, like no matter what I do things will never change, and at the idea that this feeling will stay with me for every second of my life I feel like I'd rather it all end. Like I don't want to kill myself, but if tomorrow I would not wake up I would be better off.

## interactions sociale

I tend to assume the worst, I spend a lot of type analysing and trying to understant what other peoples want or feel. 

Sometimes, when I am with others, I focus too much on looking normal, that I disconnect from the moment. I put so much effort on not showing how unconfortable I am that I forget to listen to what people are saying. I am acutely aware of my breathing, of my posture, of maintaining eye contact, making at a normal pace, what do I do with my hands.
I have a hard time understanding other peoples, and I compensate by analysing their behaviour and langage to assess their thought pattern, mostly to know how safe I can be around them.

I take responsability for the feelings other peoples get when they are around me, and I never try to understand if they are legitimate or not.

## perception sociale

I don't understand why I am different from other peoples.

I learned to mimic the behaviour of peoples around me, and I learned what behaviour I had to avoid doing in public, or what I should not say.

I don't mask because I want to be neurotypical, I mask because :
 * I have been punished and humiliated sincce I was a child because I'm not "acting normal"
 * People make me feel like my issues are a burden to them
 * People make me feel I they are ashamed to be seen with me

If I suffer in private people think that I'm pretending, that I exagerate, that I'm seeking attention, that I'm giving excuses.
If I suffer in public people get mad at my because now my issues affect them.

I feel like no matter what I do I am never enough.

I don't beleive my friends really like me, they like the version of me when I am in control of my symptoms, when I can perfectly pass as normal.

## ADHD 

I function better under pressure.

I get stucked when I have to do things for myself but I can easily do them if it's someone else's sake.

Being a procrastinator and a perfectionist so your constantly stressed over the quality of work you havent even started.

I don't really control my facial expressions, and sometime if I'm not focussing on anyting in the outside world, if I think about sayling someting or doing a movement I will say the thing or do the movement.

## Depersonnalisation

I don't feel like I am in my own body, like I don't feel in the room, like there is a buffer between reality and me, I am not in the moment and I am not in the place.
I don't know I to feel my feelings. The hurt never pass, and the joy never last. 

When I'm hurt, the feeling stagnate and all my thoughts revolve around it. But I can never get closure, the only way to move on is to analalise everything that append, try to understand how and why, and either understand how it was my fault, and why this feeling is not legitimate, or try to understand what I did to be in this situation an figure out a plan to never be there again.

I can be happy, but I don't feel happy; I have the information of what I should feel, and I remember what I should be feeling in my body, but it does not. And in the few times when I feel a twinge of someting in my body it only last a few seconds, and then nothing. Juste a feeling of nostalgia for emotion, and the sensation of missing something in my body.

================ 

I don't feel like I have suffered enough in life to deserve to be as broken as I am right now.

I feel like all the systems I set in place to protect me are failing me, because now I can't function while they are in place, but I don't know what else to do. I feel like I no longer have control over them, but they control me.
