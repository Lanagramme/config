Evil dr who

Hyper smart quick witted god who loves himself and his powers.
Drowning in guilt and self loathing.
Ultimately a force for good in the universe.
Know the secret of the city, depressed, dont know if he lives in the first layer.

Thinks he is cool but is incredibly uncool.
Lots of truama becs keep seing his friends die and forget him when they comes back.

Loves to party and jokes in the face of death.

tells you enough of what you need to know to whant to do what he needs from you without ask you directly and have you think it was always your idea so he can have you owe him for the info 

never lies but always play on the specific word used to tell his version of events

likes to mess with peoples, will make things more difficult for you just to see how you would react. believe that your true self is revealed by overcoming hardships in a way that pushes you out of your confort zone, so you can act as you'd like to think you would but have to find what you really want and what you really are willing to do to get what you want

help us!
i think i have help enough, after all, you already owe me so much

i'd wager my left eye for that sort of knowledge

I'd give my left hand for a chance to fight you fair and square

I said i wanted a chance to do it, not when i want that chance to come

will end up giving up one of his eyes, will summon two birds as famillars

a character who will see you as inferior if they are the one you come to for intel. They will lie to you and wanipulate you to they advantage using your ignorance against you. If you ar knoledgeable thet will become interested in you and treat you with regard, not daring to lie to much but testing your knoledge, giving more to gain your trust.


I can't explain to much, but, yeah. You recognized your own handwriting so no introductions needed. Something happend, you remember the case 31 ? try to focus and the details will come at you. You were right, you came here to find the last piece, but... it happend. I chose to erase our memory. I had to. But you still need to figure out the trut, you can do it,  you already have.

a mysterious house, memories locked into rooms, the caracter can read journals, look at photos, consume tea, herbs, listen to music, dressup, to bring new memories . Every change leads to something new coming out, most secrets needing a combinaison of setting to reveal themself

==================

a character accused to be part of an evil group, will do its best to prove he is not, will be rejected anyway, have to fight for its survival, choose to go to the evil group for help since they are the only group who will accept him turns out the rumor was started by the group which wanted him to join
