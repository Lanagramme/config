Malika is used to being revered for a beauty and find it hard to connect with people because of it. Her girl friends are secretely jealous of her but floak around her to profit from the advantages she gets. Her boy friends only see her for her body and only pretend to care about what she likes to gain her favours. People around her are always nice to her, but she can see in their eyes that they don't consider her like an equal. Restorators want her to keep coming to their store so male clients would want to come in, stores keeper treat her well because they hope someone with as much of a following as her will influence other into buying their marchandise, older women always compare her to themself at the same age, and older men leer on her with leecherous eyes or scoff at her for being to aluring.

She consider it normal to profit from what is given freely to her, but don't hold much consideration for people around her.

- When you find a 50 dollar bill on the ground, your first reation is not to give it to sharity, you take it perisod.

Whe she meet Lucian, she find it strange that someone could look at her with gratitude, something no one ever gave her. 

Lucian is the first person she meets who is really interested in classical litterature, and even if the like different periods and authors, and can't find an agreement on any subject, she likes conversing with him since he's the only person she knows who dare to tell her when he thinks she is wrong. 

She will come to hate him when he would fall for her, accusing him of being like the others and refusing to talk to him for a month. She would even go as far as date his bully, just to get back at him.

Lucian will meet another girl with whom he will get a cruch and start dating her. At about the same time, Malika will come to miss the way Lucian looked at her, with a mix of admiration and genuine happiness to be in her company. For her it is normal to admire her, but Lucian's admiration is the only genuine one. 

She will developpe an extreme jealousy when she realises that Lusian is in couple. Lucian's admiration is supposed to be hers and hers alone.

But since she never had to ask for anything, nor have she ever felt jealousy, she will try so stay his friend, since in her eyes, he will come back to her when he realises how inferior his actual girlfriend is.

At the same time, Lucian's Girlfriend will come to hate having Malika around. She isn't used to be looked at by boys, and feels that Lucian will leave her if Malika stays to close to him. But Lucian never actually does, wich lead her to grow resent full to him, because she feels that he's the one responsable for her feeling of uneasiness, for not understanding her feeling. When Malika's ex will come to seduce her to get back at Lucian, she will easily be swayed by his words and will start a two timing relationship.

When Malika learns it she get mad and threaten her, but she only answer back that she hates to see all the boys she feels she owns turn to her.

Those words trouble Malika who starts to doubt her own feelings.

She will nevertheless tell Lucian about it, after drinking a full bottle of skotch to get courage.

Lucian will get devastated and break up on the spot with his girlfriend who will accuse him of only waiting for an excuse to date Malika. He will not coment, just leave. 

Malika fill feel guilty and sad for Lucian, feelings she never felt for anyone else, and will start to wonder what she realy feels for Lucian. But when seeing Lucian devastated by the betrayal of his ex and trying to hold on despite the pain, she decides to keep her feelings for herself and just be there for her friend.
