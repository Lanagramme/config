It is really dangerous to channel magic energy through your own body, 

The concept of room

when performing a spell, mages gather energy from the three elements inside their body. the amount of energy that a body can hold at a given time is called a room. magic spells are performed by gathering energy inside one's room, end giving it form, before releasing it into the world

The amount of energy one can store inside a room isn't set and can be increased by training, althougt, more energy does not mean more power. 

a spell is like a recepy for one serving, if you put to much ingredients it overflows form the plate


gathering

the first step in spel casting is being able to gather energy from an element inside one's room.  although not the hardest step, it requires understang of one's own body, in order to waster the flow of energy around and inside the body

compressing


this step requires the mage to come as close as possible to it's limits and stay is this state while controling the magic inside the body

expanding

expanding is the hardest form of magic controll. It demands to willingly push the body beyond its limit. A magus in state of expension is capable of gathering energy outside of it own body to surpass the limitation of it's own room, however, the expansion state is an unstable one and it imposes a great tall on the body, moreover, the energy from outside the body can be seen and used by other mages against the user

mixing

mixing is an advances form of gathering wich allows the user to hold energies form two different elements at the same time. While mixing there is always a dominant element and a secondary one, whose balance is essential to maintain to keep the room stable.
