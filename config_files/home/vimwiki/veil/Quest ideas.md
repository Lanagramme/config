Idealist has a plan to change things 
realist points out things are more coplicated
you decide to go with the plan
realist turns on you last second epliaining that idealist does not have what it takes to make their plan real, and after the big coup is over they have no idea how to make thinds last
realisst wants to make tings better, but not overturn everything in order to protect those who will have to suffer the consequences
=> 
if you side with realist, things barely improve except for specific characters while a lot of ppl siding with idealist will be mat at you
	if you can convince idealist they were not cut for the job they will not be mat at you
	if you accept to take a seat in realist's throne room idealist will hate you
if you side with idealist, things improve at first but quiclky go to worst after the plan
	if you do every quest coming from the zone before advancing the story, you can prevent the zone from dying, but you will loose a lot of oportunities
