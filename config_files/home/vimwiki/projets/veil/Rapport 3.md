# The principles of spell castings

There are five essentials for spellcasting.

**Mana** 

Mana fuels all form of spell casting; magic could in escence be reducted as the
manipulation of mana to change reality. Emanates from the heart of the cosmos,
mana flow freely across the universe, crossing through all matter. It is
generaly invisible and intangible in it's raw form but can gain a color as it
takes the properties of **elements**. In this sense, it can be compared to
light : just as white light contains all wavelenghts of visible light, raw mana
encompass all forms of magic, but they can't be accessed without a prism to
separate and magnify them. 

Although Mana is present in all matter, in can be stored in different forms
inside of artefacts, cristals and cristal like objects, or distilled and
concentrated in potions. 
 
**Input**

proficiency the location of the door says something about the spellcaster the
door has levels

the body / the area traversed by the spell/ the zone the spell interacted with
