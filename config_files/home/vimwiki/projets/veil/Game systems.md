# Make the everyday life a game

* At the beginning of the game, you are hosted at the school dormitory for free two week. 
  You are a [Scholarship Studend](#scolarship)

* At the end of the second week, 
  * If you buy a house before the deadline you become a [citizen](#citizenship)
  * If you join a brotherhood before the deadline you will leave the dormitories to live in your [House](#brotherhood).
  * This will unlock [the dean quest line](#the-dean-quest-line)
 
 * If you can pay, the dean will offer you to work for him starting if you come at the top of the ranking. 
 * 
 * you will need to choose a sorority at the end of the week to apply to and will live in their house. 
 * Each sorority has it's own perks, bonusses, social opportunities, and questlines, but adopting one will render impossible the completion of the others unless you quit. 
 * Quitting a sorority will make every one of their members  your ennemies, unless you max out their social link, and will place you at the bottom of the school social hierarchy, but will give you the hability to change house. 
 * You can never return to a sorority you quitted. 
 * You can buy yourself a house even if you live in a sorority. 
 * Sororities have their own crafting installations and acces to specific materials at lower cost. 
 * You can skip classes any day if you do not live in the dormitories. 
 * Going to school increase your academics, your knowledge stat, unlock spells prerequisites (mastering a certain subject can be a prerequisite to unlock a skill branch), learn new spells and new combos. 
 * You will also have field trips, assignments, and quests. each give rewards. 
 * As a city home owner, you can enter any sorority (as long as you are not part of one) by getting a member to vouch for you at the house reunion (every two week, the other week is house party). 
 * The quest to obtain a voucher are hidden and require a high level of friendship.

## Scolarship
 * As a scolarship student, you will automatically go to class every morning and will have the afternoon an evening as free time, where you can socialize, work, study, participate in activities (sport, music, dungeon, find more) which will reward you with stuff and money. 
 * The rent should be equivalent to the amount gathered by working four days a week and buying nothing but food, but it is possible to make more money than working with the others activities (winning the sport championship, selling a rare instrument you can get by finishing the music quest line before the end of the month (play 4 time a week every week), winning in the underground dog fighting pit (4 match a week, do not miss any), random event (food lotery?), find more) even tho the amount is not guaranted and the only way to make sure to get enough is to invest in the quest. If you come close but not enough, a character can offer to lend you the money in exchange for services. During the month, many NPCs will mention the rent situation so the player keep it in mind. 

## Brotherhood

## The dean quest line

## Citizenship
 * four houses will be availible with monthly rent, each with different size, fonctionalities, extension possibilities and with importants spots at proximity. You can upgrade your living conditions at the end of each week if you can pay the monthly rent and the moving costs.

## Homelessness

 * As a homeless you have to find a place to sleep every night (bench, bridge, sewer) or you will fall from exaustion, resulting in you being transported  to the infirmary where you will be healed but will have to pay. 
 * if you can't pay you gather debt. 
 * if your debt exceed a certain amount you will no longer be accepted resulting in your character loosing counsiousness and waking up at the same spot the next day at noon, with less energy for the day, a bad smell, and penality on each roll for the day. 
 * A cheat will be to find a spot in the sewers you can turn into your place, or squat an abandonned house.
