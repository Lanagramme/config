when the fear of the return of the dark lord was the greatest, heger was forced into existence, but he was at first, a mere shadow. With no will of his own, and no real goal, he just repeated what his past self did. But in time, the more people feared him, pooring into him their own sense of what he was, he gained a counciousness. And with it, a sens of self. But, as he realized what he was, he only fall into despair. Realizing he was not trully human, only an amagalmation of collective conciousness and fear, he saw no purpose to his life other than being someone else's puppet. At first, he fell into a blid rage, and relentlessly attack the city, a moitié pour se défouler et à moitié espérfant qu'il finirai par mourrir. But everytime he fell in battle, he woke up in the forest, and as people kept watching him fall and come back, their fear of him grew stronger, they started comming with explanations to what he was and how come he couldnot die, and doing so, they only made him stronger.

The more they researched ways to defeat him, the more they feared him when he would still come back no matter what, and the more they tried ways to undersand what he was, the more they would fear him, pondering how many horrors were outside and how strong they could be

As time passed, and the fear of the city kept nurishing his anguish, he started to gain knowledge from the tales the people told about him. As people thought of him as the dark lord resurected, and searched in the records of the time how he was defeated, he to learned of the strength, the power, and the knowledge of his image. Every time they recalled his strategies, his deceptions, his vicroties and losses, he gained insight of a truly brillant mind, and absorbed the knowledge, making it ihs own, and developping his own abilities to match those of the true dark lord. As people started seing as a monster in human form, he gained attributes of monster, and by using the knowledge of the dark lord and his new found nature, he gained control over the monsters, and united them into an army. But, those were not the only theories trying to decifer his nature.

In time, he gained knowledge of the pillar and of his role in the preservations of melmories. And, with his wits and knowledge of the dark arts, he realized where to look for death. By destroying the pillar, he could put an end to his existence. But he knew he wasn't strong enough yet. And he devised a plan.

From that day, his attack were no longer uncoordinated feats of rage, but meticulously planned attacks of an army of beasts which would terrorize the city and cause destrution and death, until the dark lord himself, came to show his power, every attack digging a little bit further than the last. Those continuous attack  nurishing the city's fear of him, and doing so his power.
