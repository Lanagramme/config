**Concept**
Arthur Blair, Dean of the Academy of Magic

Arthur Blair, the dean of the Academy of Magic, is a paradox wrapped in enigma and draped in flamboyant robes. Hyper-intelligent and quick-witted, Arthur revels in his vast magical prowess and keen intellect, exuding an aura of self-assured arrogance. However, beneath his confident exterior lies a man drowning in guilt and self-loathing, haunted by the secrets of Naur and uncertain if he even exists in its first layer. His bravado, often seen as "cool" by himself, is tragically uncool to those around him, making him a figure of both admiration and pity.

Despite his personal demons, Arthur remains a staunch force for good in the universe. His life is a cycle of trauma, repeatedly witnessing the deaths and resurrections of friends who inevitably forget him, yet he faces this with a sardonic sense of humor and an insatiable love for parties. His laughter in the face of death is both a coping mechanism and a statement of defiance.

Arthur is a master manipulator, never lying but deftly playing with words to present his version of events. He has a unique talent for subtly guiding others to do his bidding, making them believe it was their own idea all along, ensuring they owe him for the information. He enjoys complicating tasks for others, believing that true character is revealed through overcoming hardships. This philosophy often pushes people out of their comfort zones, forcing them to confront their true desires and limits.

His lust for power and knowledge cost him one of his eyes, a sacrifice he wears as both a badge of honor and a constant reminder of his relentless pursuit of magical mastery. Arthur Blair is a man of contradictions, a tragic hero who, despite his flaws, remains dedicated to the greater good.
