Lots of truama becs keep seing his friends die and forget him when they comes back.

Loves to party and jokes in the face of death.

tells you enough of what you need to know to whant to do what he needs from you without ask you directly and have you think it was always your idea so he can have you owe him for the info 

never lies but always play on the specific word used to tell his version of events

likes to mess with peoples, will make things more difficult for you just to see how you would react. believe that your true self is revealed by overcoming hardships in a way that pushes you out of your confort zone, so you can act as you'd like to think you would but have to find what you really want and what you really are willing to do to get what you want

**Quotes**
"help us!"
"i think i have help enough, after all, you already owe me so much"

"i'd wager my left eye for that sort of knowledge"

"I'd give my left hand for a chance to fight you fair and square"

"I said i wanted a chance to do it, not when i want that chance to come"

"will end up giving up one of his eyes, will summon two birds as famillars"
