You know what ? Yeah, I'm a ..., and you know what happend when someone says no to a ... ? Exactly. So let's make things easier for you and faster for me and just give me what I asked for while I'm still asking nicely.


====================

light come from the enligntment of one self upon it self, but darkness is the refusal of that light, and comes in hiding from it 
light requires the understang of ones own darkness to master it, but darkness requires nothing
understanding yourself leads to come closer to your lignt


========================

grey mages who refuse emotion so they can better reach light
can manipulate elements but not create them
believe conjuring what is not is immoral
live in harmony with the magic and do not weild it, just influence
can all levitate, master space manipulation

=======================

a party wich does not care for what side will win, just that the winner is powerfull enough to help them prosper.
why do you want so much  to be rich ?
 - fear poverty
 - want to prove their valor
 - like the game of power
 - want to advance the mage world
=====================

- we need to stop diluting our blood and focus on nurturing a strong futur generation
- we will die if we stay alone
- a small generation of seventh will be enough to invert everything, the medling should occure only when we are sure to be the ones gaining from it
- our kind is already blooming from the outside
- collaterals, 
- our number are dwindelling
- natural selection
- we are dying
- the seventh will save us
- the last seven was decades ago, how do you know the legend is real
- i have faith! the magic will favor me as it always has favored the faithfull

fire and ice from motion
air and water from control
earth and green from empathy

======================

a character you have to work with but who sees you as inferior if you follow it's way leading him to keep it's secrets, but who dispise you if you go agains them, and you become better at telling their lies if you go aginst their wants and question them. will tell you the truth begrudgingly if you act as someone they can not look down upon

========================

a character who will see you as inferior if they are the one you come to for intel. They will lie to you and wanipulate you to they advantage using your ignorance against you. If you ar knoledgeable thet will become interested in you and treat you with regard, not daring to lie to much but testing your knoledge, giving more to gain your trust.


I can't explain to much, but, yeah. You recognized your own handwriting so no introductions needed. Something happend, you remember the case 31 ? try to focus and the details will come at you. You were right, you came here to find the last piece, but... it happend. I chose to erase our memory. I had to. But you still need to figure out the trut, you can do it,  you already have.

a mysterious house, memories locked into rooms, the caracter can read journals, look at photos, consume tea, herbs, listen to music, dressup, to bring new memories . Every change leads to something new coming out, most secrets needing a combinaison of setting to reveal themself

==================

a character accused to be part of an evil group, will do its best to prove he is not, will be rejected anyway, have to fight for its survival, choose to go to the evil group for help since they are the only group who will accept him turns out the rumor was started by the group which wanted him to join
