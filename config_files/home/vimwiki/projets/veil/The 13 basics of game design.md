# The 13 basics of game design

## Direction

**1. Focal point**

Nevet let it to the player to guess what they should focus on.  
Always allow secondary subject matter, but clearly provide primary focus.  
This applies to both visual and visceral aspecty of gameplay.

*Level design exemple*  
Creating clear, apparent lines of sight.

**2. Anticipation**

Setup and payoff. An event is more impactfull if adequate exectation for it is layed.  

*Level desing exemple*  
A train sound effect occurs before player sees train.

*System design exemple*  
An energy charge builds before the lighting attack occurs.

**3. Annonce change**

Communicat all changes to the player.
Like anticipation the level of indication must be adequate; 
A good rule of thumb is degree of rarity. If a change occurs a hundred times in an hour, the announcement may not be required. However, if the change occurs five times throughout the entire game experience, a number of visual cues could be needed.  

*Level design example*  
The steps sound effect change as the surface the character walks on change

*System design example*  
An on-screen notification occurs when quest criteria have been completed

## Behaviour

**4. Beliveability** 

Every event or behavior must occur according to the logic and expectations of the player.

*Level design example*  
Place destructible objects near an explosive object. This way, the explosion looks more believable.

*System design example*  
Weaker enemies run away when the advantage shifts in the player's favor.

**5. Overlapping events and behaviour** 

Dynamic is lost if only one change occurs at a time.

*System design example* 
Unlocking a new crafting tool unlock new recepies

*Story Example*  
Multiple plot points are at the forefront of the narrative experience. Example: the king is on his deathbed while his war is being waged and he has yet to announce an heir -- all while an unknown saboteur orchestrates a military coup.

**6. Physics**

The player's primary logic operates within the known possibilities of physics. Keep in mind gravity, weight, mass, density, force, buoyancy, elasticity, etc. Use this as the starting point, but do not be limited by it.

*System design example*  
A spark particle effect occurs when the player's vehicle scrapes the side of the concrete wall.

*UI example*  
The GUI's theme references scrapbook elements. In which case, animated transitions, highlights, etc. follow the physical characteristics of paper.

**7. Sound**  

Ask yourself, "What sound does it make when ________ happens?" "Is the sound appropriate?" "Is the sound necessary?" "Does it benefit the experience or hinder it?" If players close their eyes, the sound alone should still achieve the desired affect.

*Level design example*  
Flies in swamp level make a sound when close to the camera.

*System design example*  
A proximity system where sound effects volume fluctuates depending on distance of game assets.

*UI example*  
Only visually prominent graphics have sound effects attached to them, so as not to muffle the auditory experience.

**8. Pacing**  

Consider rythmes.
At what rythm progress the story ?
At what rythm progress the story's current beat ?
At what rythm progress the scene ?
Is the rythm of the attack satisfying ?
Does it convey the impact ?

*Level design example*  
Create areas for the player to admire the expansive view, versus areas where the player feels claustrophobic.


**9. Spacing**  

Understand how much space is available both on-screen and in-world, recognize the spatial relationship between elements and take into account the effects of modifying those spaces.

10 Linear design versus component breakdwn

Learn when to lay the foundations and when to focus on the details.
Know when to adapt to things as they come and when to stop to make a plan.

*Level design example*  
Typical blocking of level geometry in an early stage of development, versus adjusting a small area of the same level to implement an idea that wasn't thought of until later.

*System design example*  

Identifying all major systems (combat, AI, input, etc), and progressively filling in various levels of detail versus conceiving the first couple of levels and extracting possible systems based on a linear player experience.

11. Player

How does the player factor into this? How does the player interact with everything that has been designed? More than just device input, address how the player contributes to the experience. If it's a good idea and you're able to convey it correctly but the player is not into it, change it or scrap it!

Level design example
How does the level's structure gides the player through the experience ?

System design example
Orchestrating progression so that the player feels empowered, determined, anxious, etc.

12. Communication

How easily can you explain a system ?
Is it a vague idea you know you know but can't put words on ?
Do you have an elevator's pitch ?

===

How do you convey the information to your player ?

Level design example
Using the elements of the environment so the player is compelled to travel in the correct direction.

System design example
Using visual cues so the player learns when to punch rather than kick, jump rather than strafe, etc.

13. Appeal

When addressing anyone, ask yourself, "Does this draw the audience in?" This applies to (but is not limited to) the player, the spectator, your fellow developers, the publisher, and their marketing team. If it's not a good idea, there's no need to continue until it becomes a good idea or is replaced by something better.

Level design example
Running down the street is not fun, but running down the street while being pursued by government secret agents is.

System design example
Punching can be fun but when the camera shakes on impact, it's even more fun.
