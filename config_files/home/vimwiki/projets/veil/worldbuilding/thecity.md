What I learned from HollowKnight

Places have stories which involve the politics of the people living there.
ex: 
 * The green path was originally the domain of Hun
 * During the pale king invasion, the mossin accepted his rule and built a path through their territory to the heart of the city
 * When the kingdom fell, the queen fled to secret grove deep in Hun's domain making it her garden
 * When the mantis lord was banned from his tribe, he stumbled upon the garden and tryed to overtake it and make it it's own, destructing most of it
 * All that is left is a ruinned structure hidden away in green path
