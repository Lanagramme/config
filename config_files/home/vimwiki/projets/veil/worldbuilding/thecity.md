What I learned from HollowKnight

Places have stories which involve the politics of the people living there.
ex: 
 * The green path was originally the domain of Hun
 * During the pale king invasion, the mossin accepted his rule and built a path through their territory to the heart of the city
 * When the kingdom fell, the queen fled to secret grove deep in Hun's domain making it her garden
 * When the mantis lord was banned from his tribe, he stumbled upon the garden and tryed to overtake it and make it it's own, destructing most of it
 * All that is left is a ruinned structure hidden away in green path

The city of Naur is divided into sixteen distinct districts, each governed by one of the seven great families. At the core of each district lies a powerful regalia, an ancient artifact that grants its bearer the ability to reshape the city's architecture and control the flow of mana. These regalias are sentient, choosing their owners based on merit and strength, a tradition that reinforces the families' strict adherence to the doctrine of blood, ensuring that only the most capable heirs maintain control. However, ownership of a regalia can be contested; if a more deserving candidate presents themselves, the regalia may shift allegiance, effectively stealing power from one family and granting it to another. Such acts of regalia theft are rare and perilous, often seen as declarations of war that could unite the other families against the aggressor. The size of a family's territory directly correlates with their influence in the city council, yet their power remains subordinate to the trium vira, the city's ruling triumvirate comprised of the dean of the academy, the president of the guild, and the army general. These three leaders ensure a balance of power and oversee the governance of Naur, maintaining stability against the constant attack of the shadows.
