#The City Behind the Veil

##City of Naur:
The city of Naur stands divided into sixteen distinct districts, each under the dominion of one of the seven great families. At the heart of each district lies a regaliaâ€”a potent, ancient artifact bestowing its bearer the extraordinary ability to reshape the city's architecture and command the flow of mana. These regalias are sentient entities, discerning their owners based on merit and strength, thus upholding the families' doctrine of blood. This doctrine ensures that only the most capable heirs retain control. Ownership of a regalia, however, is not absolute; should a more deserving candidate arise, the regalia may shift its allegiance. Such a transfer of power, though rare and fraught with peril, is considered an act of war, often rallying the other families against the aggressor.

###Governance of Naur:
The expanse of a family's territory directly influences their power within the city council, yet their authority is ultimately subordinate to Naur's ruling triumvirate. This triumvirate comprises the Dean of the Academy of Magic, the President of the Alchemists' Guild, and the Army General. Together, these three leaders ensure a balance of power and oversee the governance of Naur, safeguarding the city against the constant threat of the shadows.

##The Families and the Triumvirate

###Origins of the Triumvirate's Authority:
During the Third Great Magic War, the Hero of Mankind clashed with the Dark Mage, wielding the power of sixteen artifacts. Ten of these artifacts were bestowed by the great families, three by the humans, and the final three crafted by the Great Alchemist. Today, these sixteen regalias empower the heart of the city's districts, controlled by their respective families.

###Post-War Foundations:
In the aftermath of the war, the Hero founded the Academy of Magic, dedicated to nurturing future generations and preventing the rise of dark mages. With the aid of the Great Alchemist, the regalia system was established, forming the basis of the districts. The Army General, who led the mages' forces against the Dark Mage's army, fortified the city against relentless shadow attacks.

###Compliance and the Hero's Power:
Although the regalias serve the families, their ultimate master remains the Hero, who retains the authority to reclaim ownership of any regalia at will. This omnipresent power ensures the families' adherence to the triumvirate's rule, maintaining the delicate balance within Naur.

What I learned from HollowKnight

Places have stories which involve the politics of the people living there.
ex: 
 * The green path was originally the domain of Hun
 * During the pale king invasion, the mossin accepted his rule and built a path through their territory to the heart of the city
 * When the kingdom fell, the queen fled to secret grove deep in Hun's domain making it her garden
 * When the mantis lord was banned from his tribe, he stumbled upon the garden and tryed to overtake it and make it it's own, destructing most of it
 * All that is left is a ruinned structure hidden away in green path
