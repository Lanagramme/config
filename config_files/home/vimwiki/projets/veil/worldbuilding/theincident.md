During the exam terrorists attack the school.
 * Plants in the examinees terrorise the students with black spells
 * A bomb explodes on the monolith
 * A covert team invade the school underground. (Secret)
In the end nobody knows what they really wanted and fear spreads among the students

The bomb fractures the monolith causing the differents districts to be separated from each others by corridors of unstable space.
Each Discrict has to gather the means to survive isolated from every other.
Each District has a theme, a story, a dominant faction.
As the story progress, efforts are made to explore the corridors in order to reconnect the diffrents districts.
There are two ways to reconnect districts:
 * Fix a section of the monolith
 * set up a ward on each side of a corridor to stabilise the space inbetween
