# Daisy's growth

 - You are not a "", you're a person. Those "" means nothing unless you decide 
	 to obide by them_ Listen, every action have consequences, and if you decide
	 to let those king of things" define you, they will be shackles to "" you. I 
	 say this because I am your friend and I care about you. Those kind of "" 
	 have a price, and I dont want to see you hurt.
 - ..., I think you underestimate me.
 - Daisy, you_ ..., Maybe I am. Maybe I should stop... 
 - You certainely should.
 - Then I hope you know what you are doing. And I wich you to be safe.
 - I do, I don't need your worries.

----------

 - I did warn you, every action have consequences.
 - I know, and I should have listen to you.
 - But you did, you listen to everything I said and then you made a choice. That's what being a mage is about, choices and consequences.
 - Please, this is not what I wanted, I just_ I dont know, I_
 - Breath. This is exactly what you asked for, you just didn't realise all it encompasses. 
 - Please, not you, don't abandon me like all the others!
 - I wont, and I am not. I am still your friend, and I don't want to see you
   hurt. But I will no longer be your get out of jail free card. You are now 
	 a proper mage, and that means you are in control of your own destiny. Right 
	 now, you are scared, because you never had to bear the full burden of weight, 
	 but I know that you are fully capable of facing it. It may sound harsh, but
	 you are the one who created this mess, and you need to take responsability 
	 for it.

 - You did it. I knew you would. Don't take it as condescention, but as your friend, I am so proud of you.
 - Ha ha. Right now, I don't really feel proud of myself.
 - You should, you took a big step today. You are now closer to reach your true potentiel than you were a few days ago.
 - And when does it start to show ? Because i feel less... I don't know exactly, but I do.
 - I did baby you to much, you were right. This is normal, the road is never 
   easy, and you rarely get rewarded for a single effort. But At some point, 
	 you will look back and see the way you <parcouru>, and realise how much you 
	 have grown. Then you will be proud.
 - Does that meen I am on my own now ? You will no longer help me ?
 - Of course I will help you! I am your friend! But I will no longer do things 
   in your stead. If you ask for my help, it will be as a fellow mage, an 
	 equal, who will assist you in your quest.
 - Ha ha. Growing sucks.
 - Yeah, it does. And that also mean that I will ask for your help to.
 - Anytime. ... Can I still have you braid my hairs ? I can't for the life of
 	 me_
 - ..._
 - I meen... As a fellow mage, would you teach me how you do it? And... assist me, if I need an extra pair of hands?
 - I'd love to.
 - Great. I really need a girl's night now.
 - Daisy, I spent the day running left and right to help people. Right now I'd like the night for myself.
 - Oh... Right.

bad ending : ----------
 - Maybe tomorrow.
 - Right, there is always tomorrow...
 - Have a good night D.
 - You too.

Daisy will feel overwhelmed and join XXX in search of a person to depend on

good ending : ----------
 - Maybe to_
 - You know what this meens ?
 - That you wont empty my tea cupboard ?
 - No silly, it means YOU need a girl's night more than anyone.
 - Daisy, I_
- And this time, I will be the one to make you tea, and I will do your hair while you can complain to me about your day.
 - Daisy... You know what ? I think I would like that.

Daisy will not join XXX, and will open her own Atelier. She will no longer have braids.
