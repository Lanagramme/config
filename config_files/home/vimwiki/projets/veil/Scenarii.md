Setup (script) and preparation (character)
Execution and struggle (Reaction and adaptation to unplanned elements) 
Payoffs (Characters arcs) and of Consequences (Story arcs)
Deliberation (Characters reaction to the event they went through)

not ready
Setup an arc toward an obvious consequence and have the characters struggle
to propare for the event, as they have to confront their own inadequacies
and start to understand how much they will have to grow before the storm.
Then the event arrives much sooner than expected. Now the caracter have to 
do their best while knowing they will never be capable to acheive a full
victory in the state they are. Mistakes will append and sacrifices will have 
to be made.

When the arc is over, the heroes will have grown in a direction different to 
the one they were heading, some realizing their true calling, and others
sacrificing their ideals and values to become someone capable to deal with
the situation, not in the best way possible but in the least worst possible.
Every change should be logical according to the character's past an personnality.
The event did not change them, juste magnified the part of themself they relied
trully on, weither they were aware of it or not.
