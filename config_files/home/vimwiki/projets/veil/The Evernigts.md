New school year at the accademy of magic. The player is part of the scolarship dorm where they are welcome by a small group of friends.

Make the dialogue introduce the characters, by demonstratig their personality through their interrests and reaction to the others all the while inting toward elements of their personal questlines relative to events that were already in motion before the begining of the story. the events in question must be linked to the state of a place or a group in the world to keep the stories anchored in the world.

Andromeda is a gambler. She plays a game of chance and skill where mages compete against one another. She use to be gifted, had a year long streak of losses during which She borrowed and lost a lot of money chasing the high of her glory days. Last night She had her first win in a long time and is excited to talk about her gain. But it is a touchy subject in their friend group; she had to borrow a lot of money in order to keep playing, money she has not been yet able to repay. She had to lie and decieve her friends who time and time again forgave her and did their best to support her and try to get her out of his trap. But every time they think she is clean, she falls back into her old habbits. They love her, and begrugingly accept that she has made her choice, but the wound is still sore. Everyone knows that the games are rigged, and winning is also part of the game, a hook to keep the player at the mercy of the house, where they will always return for another taste. This time though, what She won was an artifact which value was underestimated by the house, an artifact they will soon be willing to go any length to get back. Andromeda is overexcited at first, but starts to feel guilt, but cannot allow it to tarnish her enthousiasm because this win could be her way to gain her feeling of pride back and, she thinks, fix everything she did wrong. gently defensive if the player do not validate her.

Toma has bearly slept the previous night and is in no mood to entertain Andromeda's self destruction. They work to earn their living at the accademy, but it is NightShade season and it came early this year, meaning their workshop schedule is out of wack. Except this is not the real reason for their lack of sleep, just the excuse. they are actually part of an eco activist group that notice perturbation in the Nightshade cycle each year and they believe someone in the evernight or a group is engaging in magic rituals that perturbate the natural cycle of mana through the woods and their work is just a cover to infiltrate the network of craftsmages, artisans and magic practitioners. She spent the week nights tailing her boss to figure out where he procures some of the ingredients in his brew, ingredients that are not supposed to be in cirtulation. It is a known fact that the mana circulating in the air in influenced by the magic practice of the area, but in it's natural cycle the energy always finds a way to balance everything. The introduction of unknown elements in the system could be the cause of the disturbance, but Toma has yet to understand the greater picture and his little gang of activist are way in over their heads even though they will never admit it. Toma is short and a sharp but not rude. Annoyed if the player validate Andromeda. Feels detached from anything that seems less important that his self imposed mission, but only realize he's gone too far when he sees he is not there for his friends. 

Tamara is the peacemeaker of the group. As the dorm president she acts as everyone's mom.

Before the evernight the district was so poor people had to eat their own mana, now they have something to be proud of, something they made themself when the city turned their back on them.
