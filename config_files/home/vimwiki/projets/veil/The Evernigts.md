Opening scene. Make the dialogue introduce the characters, express their personality and give secret clues toward elements of their personal quests relative to events that happened just before the begining of the story. the events in question must be linked to the state of a place or group in the world.

One character is a gambler. They play a game of chance and skill with high stakes. They use to be gifted, but lost their luck. Since they lost and borrowed a lot of money trying to relive their glory days. Last night they had their first win in a long time and are excited to talk about their gain. But their friends are all closed to the subject. They all lost money, time, and sometime more trying to help them get away from that life, and are disapointed to see them fall back into it. everyone knows that the games are rigged, and winning is also part of the game, a hook to keep the player at the mercy of the house, where they will often return for another taste. This time though, what they won was an artifact which value was underestimated by the house, an artifact that the house is now willing to use any mean to get back.

The Other character has bearly slept the previous night and is in no mood to entertain sensless talk. They work to earn their living at the accademy, but it is "find a name for it" season. And it came early this year, causing a buildup at their work. Except this is not the real reason for their lack of sleep.
