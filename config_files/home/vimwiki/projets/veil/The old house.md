## Setting

Four young adults wake up in an old house with no memory of how they ended up there. After exploring the house they discover they each have a room in their name, there is no way for them to leave the house, and they apparently chose to be here of their free will.

Doubt quickly arise between them and they each start to wonder if the one responsible for their situation is one of them, or if they are watching the whole thing form afar. 

They reluctantly agree it would be more productive to cooperate in order to escape the place, but the more paranoid openly display their mistrust toward the others. 

As they explore the manor, they find themself trapped in a room in which they have to sole a puzzle to escape. As they do, they find a key opening a closed door inside the manor. the door lead to another puzzle, this one not trapping them but requiring a thourough exploration of the manor to be solved. Their prize is yet another key. They quicly conclude that by solving all the puzzles and finding all the keys, they will be able to leave. 

Quicly after, the player character comes to the realisation that every one except them has the ability to use magic except for them.

In secret, your true goal was to use their essence to gain power of your own. 

Peole from the first house were there to grant somethind to perform the ritual and people from the second house were there because they have a power you wanted.

 * Investigation: The player is free to roam around the map, interacting with the environment and other characters in order to solve puzzles in order to move the plot forward
 * Free time: Between investigations, the player is free to roam around the map and interact with other characters. There is no defined goal to these sections exept for exploring the map and talking with the characters. There are secrets hidden all around the map, painting a wider picture about the plot and the world of the game, and by talking with the characters, the player deepen their bonds with them, learning more about them and their life outside the manor.

The game will altern between investigations and free time, during free time, there will be at regular intervel insentives for the player to explore, but they do not need to explore the whole manor to advnce the plot, just enough to trigger the next investigation phase.

### Dialogue

 - What's the deal with her ?
 - Well, I can see her point.
 - Huh ?
 - In a potentially dangerous situation, with a bunch of unknown variables, it makes sense to distrust anyone you do not know.
 - That souds paranoid to me, like everyone is a culprit to you just because you don't know who is ?
 - Rather, anyone "could" be a culprit so its better not to risk it.
 - And you agree with that ?
 - Maybe not
