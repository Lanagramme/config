# The human side

The landscape whanged so much during the war that the need for explorers, cartographes and adventurers of all sorts launched a new age of discoveries and conquests.
The residual energies of spells still infect the land, creating weirds occurences.
Certain zones where a lot of exotic matter still linger are corrupted by the memories of battles, creating large scale tempest of magic.
Humans hunt and trade magic artefact.
Adventurers are always in search of artifacts which could increase their capacities for exploration or fighting.
