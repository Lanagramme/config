I need to focus my energy on the crafting or a better man.
I keep getting sidetracked by differents goals whick do not bring me closer to the man I want to be.
It would be a better idea to create processes instead of goals.  
I would focus on what I want to be and what system I can create to day after day come closer to my goal.
Then if a goal arise, I will integrate it inside of my regular process.
If there is a piece I want to create, I will use it as a base for my regularly schuedled practice.

What do I want to be ?

Wake up early
Exercise
Play the piano
Draws
Write
Code
Read fiction
Knolegeable
Gardener
