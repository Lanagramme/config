## Notes

I clearly lack a strong male figure, and I don't have a mentor. All my life I've been struggling with questions about my role in a society of my pairs, how to act in socal situations, and what I should strive to achieve with my time on this eart. And with no one to turn to, I Feel as lost today as I was years ago.

Unfortunately for me, I am now supposed to have my life on the rails to a stable situation, but I still don't know which way to go with my life. I sure have dreams, but I don't know what path I should take to acheive them, and I am still dealing with issues from my unresolved childhood and adolescence. All of this whili I try to navigate the responsabilities comming with my age.

Lonelyness and depression became a constant state of mind and I don't see how to break out of it.




The energy you put out attract a certain kind of people.
