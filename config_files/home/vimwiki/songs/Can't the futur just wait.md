# Cant the futur just wait

============
Can't the futur just wait
Can't the deadlines come fashonably late
I could push every goal back 
Take control back
If they'd roll back the rate
I wish time started to fly
Never landing or standing by
Never taking a break
Ever making me retry
We're nickel and dime
Every quarter to two
But maybe it's time to let time pass through
