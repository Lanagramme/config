This... this is earth magic.

What ? No ! I'm telling you, it's lunar magic, all spells derives their effectiveness from the moon's impact on the tides of naturally flowing mana through the eather ! Look, you can event see it !

What you do is use an alternate fuel source to alter the effect of botanicular spells, the effect of the moon cycles on the "tides of mana" as you call them is well known and already documented. You would have had no difficulties to find about it if you bothered to go to the library. And they were found to be negligeable.

You just call them negligeable because you dont understand them ! you cast them as useless just because they do not conform to your preconcetions ! you never gave them a chance !

Like we did to you ?

...

You would like lunar magic to be real, because if it was, it would make you somethiing important. The outcast student whom no teacher, stuck in their old way could recognize the genius of, who unearth a new kind of magic, never seen before, proving them wrong and taking his well deserved place amongst the great. But if you take a step away from your fantasies, you would realise that you are nothing but a lazy fool, looking for an easy way out to success.

quand vous avez mentionné le plagiat j'ai sssu que     vvvvvous disize la vérité, c'est pour ca que je me suios opposé à vous avec tnt de force

l'auto préservation est sa première motivation

il l'a poussé à passer un contrt avec eux sachant que son obsession pour sa propre libreté la poussera a chercher à le briser

tu as écrit un contra avec moi qui ne peut etre brisé qu'à ta mort et c'est moi l'idiote?

meme s'il ne m'aime pas, ce osnt des altruistes, et leur nature ne les autorisera jamais à ma laisser mourir devant eux
