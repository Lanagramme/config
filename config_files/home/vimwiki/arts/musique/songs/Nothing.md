D . A/C# . Bm . D7/A
Track suits and red wine Movies for two
G . D/F# . E7 . Asus
We'll take off our phones And we'll turn off our shoes
D . A/C# . Bm . D7/A
We'll play Nintendo Though I always lose
G . D/F# . E7 . Asus
'Cause you'll watch the TV While I'm watching you

D . F#7 . Bm D9
There's not many people I'd honestly say
G . D/F# . E7sus4 . E7
I don't mind losing to 
Em9 . . GM9 . C7
But there's nothing Like doing nothing
D . . Em9 . A7
With you

D . A/C# . Bm . D7/A
Dumb conversations We lose track of time
G . D/F# . E7 . Asus
Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine
D . A/C# . Bm . D7/A
We'll watch The Notebook For the 17th time
G . D/F# . E7 . Asus
I'll say "It's stupid" Then you'll catch me crying

D . F#7 . Bm D9
We're not making out On a boat in the rain
G . D/F# . E7sus4 . E7
Or in a house I've painted blue 
Em9 . . GM9 . C7
But there's nothing Like doing nothing 
D . . Em9 . A7
With you

So shut all the windows And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor

Mmm
D . A/C# . Bm . D7/A
You could be dancing on tabletops Wearing high-heels
G . D/F# . E7 . Asus
Drinking until the world Spins like a wheel
D . F#7 . Bm D9
But tonight your apartment Had so much appeal
G . D/F# . E7sus4 . E7
Who needs stars? We've got a roof
Em9 . . GM9 . C7
But there's nothing Like doing nothing
D . . Em9 . A7
With you
Mmm
Em9 . . GM9 . C7
No, there's nothing Like doing nothing
D . . Em9 . A7
With you
