# 7 Things

C                                   E
I probably shouldnt say this but in times I get so scared
       Am                          G
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
      F                                  Am                         G
It was awesome, but we lost it, it's not possible for me not to care
              F                                  Am                         G
And now we're standing in the rain, and nothings ever gona change Until you hear, my dear, 

## Chorus
                                  C E Am
The seven things I hate about you
G                             F      G
The seven things I hate about you
C                    E                Am
 You're vain, you're games, you're insecure, 
             G 
You love me, you like her
    F      
You make me laugh, you make me cry,
    G
I don't know when ... goodbye
C                E                              Am
Your friends are jerks but you're not like them 
    G
???
  F                            G
I Wanna be with the ones I know

And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do 

You make me love you
