# The Invisible Horror of 'The Labyrinth'
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch/XMFhD9JB9bQ)

00:00:05.880 When I tell you Simon Stålenhag’s The Labyrinth is a maze you’ll never escape… I don’t think  
00:00:12.480 I’m exaggerating. A sci-fi horror artbook where a mysterious phenomenon turns Earth  
00:00:18.120 into a world of ash and decay, the setup seems simple. Likewise, the characters — a trio of  
00:00:25.860 survivors journeying across the wastes — seem easy to relate to. Yet the deeper you venture,  
00:00:31.740 the more you realize The Labyrinth is a complex tangle of secrets, mysteries,  
00:00:37.200 and revelations so gripping that it never truly lets you go. So, for this entry into the archive,  
00:00:44.640 we’ll attempt to decipher this masterpiece of dark worldbuilding. And like my videos on  
00:00:50.280 Stålenhag’s other series, you can purchase the artbook using the links in the description. Now,  
00:00:56.220 let’s enter the maze of The Labyrinth…

00:00:56.220 The end of the world begins with a whisper. Mysterious black  
00:01:06.420 globes appear in the sky one day, their arrival so subtle and quiet it is at first thought to be some  
00:01:13.020 sort of natural cosmic phenomenon — as if Earth simply drifted into an unknown part of the galaxy.  
00:01:19.320 Yet the spheres seem to move in formation, gliding through the landscape like they’re following a  
00:01:25.980 coordinated plan of action. And soon, planet Earth begins to wither, the atmosphere growing toxic  
00:01:32.460 over a timescale of decades. It is a chillingly subtle apocalypse, slow and almost imperceptible.  
00:01:40.140 All attempts to destroy the globes prove futile, with military crafts left warped into dreamlike  
00:01:47.220 spirals of matter — as if space itself has been twisted. Rendered completely inoperable,  
00:01:52.920 these misshapen weapons lie forgotten in fields alongside all hope of defeating the spheres.  
00:01:59.640 The apocalypse in The Labyrinth is so far beyond human comprehension that the narrative could  
00:02:05.580 be classified as ‘Cosmic Horror’ — a genre that extracts terror from the unknowable and  
00:02:11.400 otherworldly. The black globes cannot be reasoned with, rationalized, or removed. They are utterly  
00:02:18.420 insurmountable: an astronomical nightmare that humanity has no hope of escaping.

00:02:25.680 The profound helplessness that incomprehensible  
00:02:31.200 phenomena instill can be better understood in conversation with the film The Endless,  
00:02:36.720 another work of cosmic horror that follows a cult which has emerged around a mysterious,  
00:02:42.120 reality-bending entity. Like the threat in The Labyrinth, the entity in The Endless is subtle  
00:02:48.780 and insidious — only perceptible in the elusive ways it warps space. Yet the dread it conjures  
00:02:55.440 is palpable, felt in scenes where cult members play tug-of-war with an unseen force in the sky.  
00:03:01.500 Or when three moons rise overhead — a visual that like the black globes of The Labyrinth conveys the  
00:03:08.760 celestial scale of the threat. “- The first one to get through the maze with all three balls lights  
00:03:13.740 up the tower! -” Over a decade after the globes’ arrival, the sun — appearing faint  
00:03:20.880 and green through an ammonia-choked atmosphere — rises over a landscape of ash and ruin. Only a  
00:03:27.360 small population of humans avoided the extinction that befell the vast majority of life on Earth.  
00:03:33.000 Yet it is in this era of dust and decay that the primary narrative of The Labyrinth begins.  
00:03:40.080 Three protagonists set out across the desert in a research vehicle. Two are siblings and employees  
00:03:45.960 of Kungshall — an underground facility that is one of the last safe havens for humanity. The third  
00:03:52.020 is a child and former refugee the siblings took in during the crisis years. All three carry with  
00:03:58.740 them dark secrets from before civilization’s fall… The trio journeys toward an uninhabited research  
00:04:06.240 outpost, the siblings hoping a break in routine will help the child, who has been showing signs  
00:04:12.120 of acute psychological distress at Kungshall. They also plan to conduct some light research on the  
00:04:18.240 changed surface. After all, such expeditions are common and should be perfectly safe…  
00:04:24.720 Yet there are other things in the otherwise barren landscape. Things that don’t resemble  
00:04:30.660 life on earth… yet seem to be alive all the same. Answers to what these entities are and why they  
00:04:37.740 seem so at home in an otherwise apocalyptic biosphere can only be found by venturing  
00:04:43.800 deeper into The Labyrinth. “- Roll the balls and roll them fast, hurry, hurry, don’t be last. -”  
00:04:51.420 After a long drive across the somber mesas, the trio at last arrives at the isolated outpost.  
00:04:58.320 Although half-buried in dunes of ash, the vacant station represents one of the last  
00:05:03.840 safe environments in the age of the globes. And yet while the interior is protected from dust and  
00:05:10.140 ruin, the environment doesn’t feel safe. In the garage, a mural depicts dandelion seeds blowing  
00:05:16.800 in the wind — a visual so incongruous with the apocalyptic reality of the planet it becomes  
00:05:23.220 almost eerie. This uncanniness only grows more intense deeper within the station, where objects  
00:05:30.540 remain stacked in neat rows. There’s a sense of desperation in these scenes: the impossibly clean  
00:05:37.140 interiors a way to pretend that nothing beyond the facility walls has changed. As a result,  
00:05:43.320 common objects take on a cadaverous quality, stuck in time like insects trapped in amber. The feeling  
00:05:50.760 of falseness can be so extreme, these interiors can seem more hostile than the barren desert  
00:05:57.420 outside — an environment that, while far from pleasant, is at the very least straightforward.  
00:06:03.300 The uncanniness that these altered interiors exude isn’t easy to put into words. Compared to  
00:06:10.560 your typical sinister locale, nothing about the research station is overtly menacing.  
00:06:16.860 And on a cultural level, we all know what a creepy interior is supposed to look like. There’s usually  
00:06:23.100 cobwebs and spiders, gothic hallways with dim lighting and long shadows — the perfect  
00:06:39.213 clean venue. Yes, it’s haunted by the dead, both metaphorically and perhaps quite literally — but  
00:06:45.873 as a hotel, it honestly looks nice. Yet through the eye of director Stanley Kubrick,  
00:06:51.633 the building feels… unwell. Everything from the dizzying patterns on the carpet,  
00:06:57.693 to the queasy colors of the rooms, to the sheer uncanniness of spaces meant to hold thousands more  
00:07:03.813 people than the three main characters, broadcasts a sense of… wrongness, for lack of a better word.  
00:07:09.753 As the leads become increasingly psychologically distressed, the unfriendly setting feels like a  
00:07:16.473 reflection of their growing mental unwellness — and perhaps even the cause. It's fitting, then,  
00:07:23.193 that the facility in The Labyrinth mirrors The Overlook Hotel — both in its unnerving aesthetics  
00:07:28.953 and disturbed occupants. For like the characters in The Shining, the three leads in The Labyrinth  
00:07:34.893 are haunted by ghosts from their past, pushing them to the point where they seem genuinely  
00:07:39.813 unstable — although for much of the narrative, it’s difficult to determine which characters are  
00:07:45.273 dangerous, and which are in danger. At the end of The Shining, lead character Jack Torrance reaches  
00:07:51.873 a point where he tries to hunt down his family with an axe. It's a looming potential outcome that  
00:07:57.573 stays with you as you read through The Labyrinth, and wonder how dark things will get before you  
00:08:03.093 reach the center... “- Dig Dug digs his own mazes. He digs for balloon-men. He digs for dragons. -”  
00:08:13.113 As a suffocating tension builds within the station, the brother and sister continue  
00:08:18.513 to make daily expeditions into the surrounding wasteland to study Earth’s new environment. And in  
00:08:24.753 the emaciated remains of what was once a city, new forms of life have arisen. Amongst the wreckage,  
00:08:31.533 gargantuan stationary organisms sprout from the ashen sand like enormous fans of coral.  
00:08:37.832 These lifeforms seem at home in the new climate, as if the globes have terraformed Earth to match  
00:08:43.773 the biosphere of their place of origin. Yet these coral specimens are just the beginning.  
00:08:49.413 Deeper within the maze of the city, tremendous stalks grow inside the husks of buildings,  
00:08:55.533 having infested the structures like hermit crabs occupying a shell. The tops of these  
00:09:01.293 stalks stretch towards the diffused green light of the sun, the scene evoking a photograph taken  
00:09:07.413 far below the waves. Imagery reminiscent of the deep sea appears throughout The Labyrinth,  
00:09:13.473 with the suits needed to survive on the surface evocative of not just astronauts  
00:09:18.573 but also old-school divers. There’s a sense of incompatibility — that the land has become as  
00:09:25.293 unsuitable for human life as the deepest oceanic trench. Elements of cosmic horror once again rear  
00:09:32.433 their heads in these scenes, as the siblings are utterly unable to explain the phenomena around  
00:09:38.433 them. In one image that didn’t make it into the final artbook, a towering squid-like creature  
00:09:44.193 spreads ribbon-shaped tentacles throughout the city. There is no understanding this new  
00:09:49.713 environment — there is only danger. In this respect, the wasteland is resonant with The  
00:09:56.793 Shimmer from the film Annihilation. A psychedelic region that an alien entity transforms into a new  
00:10:03.333 ecosystem, The Shimmer can be deadly for humans to traverse. Yet like Earth in The Labyrinth,  
00:10:09.153 The Shimmer isn’t devoid of life — instead, it’s overflowing with new types of organisms. In fact,  
00:10:15.993 it’s left ambiguous if the force behind The Shimmer even comprehends that it’s causing  
00:10:20.973 harm — an ambiguity that extends to The Labyrinth. Although little comfort to the survivors,  
00:10:27.213 there’s a possibility the near-extinction of humanity was just an accident — the  
00:10:32.613 unintentional byproduct of some unrelated operation. The new world might be toxic to  
00:10:38.373 lifeforms adapted to the old one — but clearly some entities prosper in these new conditions,  
00:10:43.953 growing to colossal sizes. Perhaps whatever intelligence is behind the changed biosphere  
00:10:49.953 thought only of the benefit to themselves, and never factored in the suffering of others. Yet  
00:10:56.793 the creators of the black globes are not the only faction in The Labyrinth that made callous  
00:11:01.773 calculations to survive. The city is haunted by organic detritus – but also the wrecks of giant  
00:11:08.673 armored drones, employed by the military police during the crisis years. And these destructive  
00:11:15.153 weapons weren’t just aimed at the globes... “- And now he’s digging his way into homes everywhere. -”  
00:11:28.113 Later in The Labyrinth, we learn that in the years leading up to the surface becoming completely  
00:11:33.753 uninhabitable, panic and desperation spread among civilians. The air became difficult to breathe,  
00:11:40.353 and refugees urgently sought shelter from the sphere’s toxins. Rumors of Kungshall — a  
00:11:47.073 hermetically sealed city with room for only one hundred-thousand inhabitants — spread to the  
00:11:52.773 desperate masses. As a carefully constructed micro-ecosystem, Kungshall could not hope to  
00:11:59.073 shelter the many needy people who sought refuge. And so, the protectors of the facility — the  
00:12:05.493 siblings included — made a grim calculation. One they’d spend the rest of their lives trying to  
00:12:11.793 justify. A massive quarantine zone was erected around the site, with heavily armed guards and  
00:12:18.333 robots patrolling the border. All possible threats to the project were annihilated. In order to save  
00:12:24.453 humanity, the employees of Kungshall believed they needed to be inhumane for a period of time.  
00:12:30.393 The strategy was simple: deterrence. Methods of instilling fear by any means necessary became  
00:12:37.473 common practice. There was no official name for what the guards of Kungshall were doing. No name  
00:12:43.713 was needed. And in many respects, the plan was a resounding success. The streams of people seeking  
00:12:50.793 safety diminished. The message had been received: whatever misery the survivors were fleeing from,  
00:12:56.913 something much worse awaited them at Kungshall. Yet cruelty does not vanish. It lingers,  
00:13:03.573 festering, in the souls of those who wield it, and in those whom it is wielded against.  
00:13:08.373 Among the refugees who suffered at the hands of Kungshall was the child the siblings would later  
00:13:14.433 take in — a decision they made to ease their guilty consciences and forget the darkness  
00:13:19.773 of the past. But what some seek to forget, others shall always remember… “- They think I’m trapped,  
00:13:27.453 but I’ll escape.” “Tunnel runner, the new video game where you don’t look down on the maze,  
00:13:31.953 you’re in it.” “Monster! -” The people in The Labyrinth are a tangle of moral complexities,  
00:13:38.253 knots you turn over and over in your head as you try to unravel them, struggling to reconcile  
00:13:44.493 their many contradictions. The characters themselves seem lost within their own memories,  
00:13:49.593 unable to decide the right path forward. This conflict is represented by a maze that comes  
00:13:56.013 from a computer game the child plays — which grows larger and larger as the story reaches its climax…  
00:14:04.233 There is a literal maze at the heart of The Shining as well, an immense expanse  
00:14:09.993 of hedges that dominate the hotel grounds. For a film known for its puzzle-like storytelling,  
00:14:15.693 it seems like a logical inclusion. Yet as is the case in The Labyrinth,  
00:14:20.493 the maze in The Shining is also symbolic of the psyche of the main characters — in particular,  
00:14:26.073 Jack Torrance and his descent into utter madness. Perhaps the greatest  
00:14:31.533 mystery of The Shining is the source of Jack’s insanity. Is it something he brought with him,  
00:14:37.353 as the film implies he abused his spouse and child in the past? Is it symptomatic of the  
00:14:43.173 hotel itself, a seemingly hostile locale? Or is it something beyond comprehension,  
00:14:49.173 the scheme of an otherworldly entity we can’t hope to understand? This plot point acts like a prism,  
00:14:55.953 with the refracted truth appearing differently to each member of the audience. The ending of The  
00:15:02.253 Labyrinth is just as multi-faceted — in fact, it might be more so. Because in The Shining,  
00:15:08.433 out of the three lead characters, there’s at least a distinct villain in the form of the  
00:15:13.413 axe-wielding Jack Torrance. But The Labyrinth has no villain, not really — just people who had to  
00:15:19.953 make terrible decisions and people who can’t let go. And while you hope they’ll be able to escape,  
00:15:25.473 to find a way out of the maze they’ve all trapped themselves in, there’s no clear exit in sight.  
00:15:32.193 Famously, in the final scenes of The Shining, Torrance becomes lost within the very labyrinth  
00:15:38.073 that represents his winding path towards insanity. The film ends not with the red-hot swing of an axe  
00:15:44.673 but with a long, slow fade-out as he succumbs to the cold of a snowstorm — the blizzard an  
00:15:50.853 apparent reminder that there are more powerful and elemental forces at work in these stories  
00:15:56.733 than humans. The Labyrinth ends with a flood. The ammonia in the atmosphere falls like rain  
00:16:04.533 and dissolves the water frozen under the ash — a final, unexpected stage of the changing Earth.  
00:16:10.833 The dark liquid wells up in the interior of the station, drowning the red corridors. And in the  
00:16:17.733 midst of this catastrophe, the pressure building within the lead characters finally bursts in a  
00:16:23.673 way I found both shocking and somehow completely inevitable considering all that came before. While  
00:16:30.333 I won’t give away all the final twists and turns to The Labyrinth, if you’d like to know everything  
00:16:35.733 that happens, you can check out the book for yourself… “- Better check the map. It’s the exit!  
00:16:42.033 To another maze… -” The Labyrinth doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Simon Stålenhag’s other works,  
00:16:51.033 Tales from the Loop and The Electric State, explore related themes of bureaucratic  
00:16:55.893 inhumanity and lingering trauma through a lens of visually-stunning sci-fi. Yet though both of the  
00:17:02.073 aforementioned works have their serious elements, I believe The Labyrinth is ultimately Stålenhag’s  
00:17:08.012 most solemn story yet — one I still feel a part of me is trapped within. While all narratives have to  
00:17:14.373 come to an end, the mysteries and tragedies of The Labyrinth lingered long after the final page  
00:17:19.863 — which is a testament to the story’s strength. All of Stålenhag’s futures are worth experiencing,  
00:17:25.953 and if you find these worlds as interesting as I do, you can purchase the artbooks using the
