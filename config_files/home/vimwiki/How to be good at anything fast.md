# How to get good at anything fast
*Learning how to learn: probably the most important skill one could acquire.*

It is a 100% learned skill and require no tallent. Its a bit like learning to 
solve a rubik's cube in a lot of ways; you just study and learn the algorithms.

### Look toward the end goal

When you learn how to drive, the first thing you are taught is to not look down,
you look as far into the horizon as you can. Even comming back to the rubik's
cube analogy, usualy they are multiple steps that look very messed up, it just 
makes no sense at all, the cube is totally destroyed, and then, in a few moves,
boom, it's solved. They were actually making progress the entire time, even
though it didn't look like that. And often time, the optimal way toward a goal
does not look the prettiest.

**Avoid the noobs traps**
For exemple, a lot of games, even well design games have a lot of noob traps. 
And it's intentionnal because you want to engage the new players, you want them
to be able to come into the game and be able to feel realy good and cool right 
from the bat. Every single games has something a new player can use to feel 
realy strong. **The number one thing you must avoid is falling into these noob 
traps**. These things wont help you at all later on. Even if you can get high 
using them, at some point you will plateau hard. Since you found a way to 
progress without having to hone your skills, past the noob zone, your tricks 
will no longer work against people with those skills you dont possess.

**What to do then ?**
You want to define the goal you want to reach, and then observe how people at 
that level operate. Understand the skills they had to develop, the habbits they
watch for their habbits, understand their mindset, their way of thinking about
and looking at their work, and learn from them. 

**The mindset**
When working toward a goal, you day by day level increase is not what you 
should focus about. No matter where you are at the current point, are you still
growing ? Are you still moving toward your goal ? That's what matter.

### Hard skills, soft skills and self discovery

**Hard skills**


**Soft skills**
Listen to pro talks, this will not help you specifically to learn anything, but
it will expand your mind, and give you background information to learn about.
Soft skills are multipliers on anything else, they dont teach you anything 
specific as long as you dont already do or learn.

**Self discovery**
Experiment.
Get your own take on things without getting tainted by outside knowledge.
When you're new you have a unique outlook that no one has. Try your own things
and then watch the meta and add to your own play
